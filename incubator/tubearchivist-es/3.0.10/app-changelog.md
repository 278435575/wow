- move everything to consume OCI-hosted common-chart dependency

- standardize ./img references ([#16704](https://github.com/truecharts/charts/issues/16704))

- lints some docs, uses front-matter instead of # h1, and fix list items in changelog ([#16589](https://github.com/truecharts/charts/issues/16589))

### Fix



- correct mistaken common references
