## [synapse-7.0.31](https://github.com/truecharts/charts/compare/synapse-7.0.30...synapse-7.0.31) (2023-05-03)

### Chore

- update container image tccr.io/truecharts/synapse to v1.82.0 ([#8263](https://github.com/truecharts/charts/issues/8263))
  
  ### Fix

- fix some invalid questions.yaml ([#8718](https://github.com/truecharts/charts/issues/8718))
  - already adapt questions.yaml GUI to prevent tests from needlessly failing for unported charts ([#8720](https://github.com/truecharts/charts/issues/8720))
