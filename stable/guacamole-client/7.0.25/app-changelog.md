### Chore

- update container image tccr.io/truecharts/guacamole-client to v1.5.1 ([#8451](https://github.com/truecharts/charts/issues/8451))
  
  ### Fix

- already adapt questions.yaml GUI to prevent tests from needlessly failing for unported charts ([#8720](https://github.com/truecharts/charts/issues/8720))
