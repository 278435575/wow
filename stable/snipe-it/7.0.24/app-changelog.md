### Chore

- update container image tccr.io/truecharts/snipe-it to v6.1.0 ([#8259](https://github.com/truecharts/charts/issues/8259))
  
  ### Fix

- already adapt questions.yaml GUI to prevent tests from needlessly failing for unported charts ([#8720](https://github.com/truecharts/charts/issues/8720))
